              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <h4>Startup Project</h4>
              <p>Timeline: Eleven Weeks (March — June 2017)</p>
              <p>UX Designer, User Researcher</p>
              <p>Skills: Needfinding, Storyboarding, Interviewing, A/B testing, Prototyping</p>
              <p>Tools used: Illustrator, Unbounce, Google Analytics/Adwords, Balsamic</p>



              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>A platform for getting film lovers back into the theaters.</p>
              <p>We get customers the best deals through flexible ticket pricing by working with local theaters. With Going, customers can go to the movies at a more affordable price with the power of crowdsourcing. Theaters set ticket goals and customers save money! The movie goers become recruiters by sharing the deal with friends and family and unlocking lower prices. Overrated prices shouldn’t stop you from the movie experience.</p>
                 
              
              <img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="public/images/Going/prototype.jpg" alt="">
              <p>In the beginning our group focused on creating a dating/social app that focused on building relationship through a planned event. However after taking a closer look at the market through competitive analysis we realize that the dating market was too saturated and dating app users are often one time users who will ultimately abandon the service after successful match or just simply gave up. Our team then shifted to crowdsourced event planning. Inspired by on campus organization that held free movie premier for students at local theaters. We chose to focus on the Cinema experience because we know that movies attract a large crowd and that the movie industry is slowly declining with streaming services becoming more popular.</p>
              <p>We created multiple storyboards reflecting on different strategies that might bring more traffic back to the theaters. We then tested these storyboards with online surveys.</p>

              <h2>Insights</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>People go to the movies infrequently</li>
                <li>Main motivation for going to the theaters include</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Social event with friends</li>
                  <li>Cheap movie tickets</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>From our surveys we learned that people are more motivated to go to the theaters when <strong>ticket deals are available</strong> and when <strong>friends plan together</strong>. With these idea in mind we came up with a businesss plan that utilized crowdfunding abilites to drive lower ticket prices. <strong>The more people commit to a movie showing the cheaper the ticket is for that showing.</strong>To test our business idea we contacted multiple local theater manager and held phone as well as in person interviews presenting our minimal viable product. We also performed service enactment with the stakeholders (movie goers, theaters) to see if they would use our product. </p>
              <p>The results were positive. Local theater supported the idea. Users liked the idea and would recommened such service amongst friends. During this process we also mentioned the possibility of bringing older films back to the theaters. </p>
              <ul class= "quotes">
                <p>The following are some quotes we received from service enactment.</p>
                <li>“AMC could see it working if Going!’s profit would be a percentage from ticket sales because Going! would refund the ticket prices”</li>
                <li>“Cheap tickets would let my friends and I go to the movies more.”</li>
                <li>“I like going to the movies when it’s opening weekend so knowing that there are a lot of people going to the showing will remake that experience.”</li>
                <li>“I like the idea of bringing old movies back to theaters.”</li>
              </ul class= "quotes">

              <h2>Prototype</h2>
              <p>Our prototype demonstrated the price unlock and commit feature.</p>
              <p><strong>Price Unlock Feature:</strong> For showings that are not projected to sell very well, theaters can offer discounts for each ticket goal set. When a ticket goal is reached, a new price drop will be unlocked. Customers can see what discounts to expect and buy tickets at the goals they want to join in on.</p>
              <p><strong>Commit Feature:</strong> They can also see how many more people need to commit to a goal in order to reach the next one.Potential customers who do not want to buy tickets right away can choose to commit to a specific ticket goal and once the goal is met, tickets will automatically be purchased for the customers.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="public/images/Going/commit.png" alt="">
              <p>We also explored with possible future function such as throwback Movies, where movie goers can relive opening weekend at an affordable price. We hope to implement a voting function for movie enthusiasts to vote on the movies they want to see in theaters again. GOING users can suggest films, anything from classic to independent or even foreign films. The movie that wins the vote will be made available in the partnered theaters.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-centered" src="public/images/Going/voting.png" alt="">
              
              <h2>Business Proposition</h2>
              <p>Because we are the middle man providing more affordable tickets from theaters to movie goers we will charge a small service fee from the movie goers and a small % per ticket sale from the theater. Percentage of ticket sale may vary due to the relationship between theaters and movie studios. Another portion of our revenue will from advertisement on the application.  </p>
